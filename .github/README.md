### **Release**

Coordinates tagging and publishing a new release with `git` and `gh`.

- review commits since last release and propose a semantic version
- craft the `<Project>: <Version> - <Title>` release title and description
- bump package metadata to the new version and commit the change
- prepare to tag and push, then wait for review before running tagging or `gh release` commands
