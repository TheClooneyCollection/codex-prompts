We are going to make a new release by using `git` for tagging and `gh` for creating the release.

Read the commits since last release and do the following.

- Propose a release version based on the changes.
- Follow the existing release title strategy. `<Project>: <Version> - <Title>`
- Prepare a release description.
- Update any package definition file with the new version number and commit.
- Run `git tag` commands with the version number and also annotate it with the release title please.
- Remember to do a `git push` before the following `gh release ...` command.
- Run `gh` to create a release

Stop before running the commands, let me revise the title, description and version number first.
